# Home Alarm System

## Overview
This repository contains the files and simulations for a Home Alarm System project. The project includes Proteus simulations, Arduino code, and sensor libraries for PIR and Flame sensors.

## Repository Structure

### Simulation.pdsprj
- Proteus project file for the Home Alarm System simulation.

### Analog PIR Sensor Library for Proteus
- **Proteus Library**: Contains the HEX, LIB, and IDX files for the PIR sensor.
- **Proteus Simulations**: Includes simulation files and Arduino code for the PIR sensor.

### Flame Sensor Library for Proteus
- Contains the HEX, LIB, and IDX files for the Flame sensor.
- **Proteus Simulation**: Includes simulation files for the Flame sensor.

## How to Use
1. Open the `Simulation.pdsprj` file in Proteus to load the project.
2. Use the provided libraries (`.HEX`, `.LIB`, `.IDX`) to simulate the PIR and Flame sensors.
3. The Arduino code for the PIR sensor is located in `Analog PIR Sensor Library for Proteus/Proteus Simulations/Arduino_Code/Arduino_Code.ino`.
